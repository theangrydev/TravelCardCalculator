This is a simple application that allows you to calculate the benefit (or not!) of purchasing a travel card.

I originally made this as part of the "Creative, Serious and Playful Science of Android Apps" Coursera course.

You can find it on the [Google Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=io.github.theangrydev.travelcardcalculator).
